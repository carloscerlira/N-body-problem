# N-body-problem
Numeric solution for the N-body problem using leapfrog integration and the Barnesâ€“Hut algorithm, the complexity of the problem was reduced from O(n^2) to O(nlogn). A visualization using OpenFrameworks for a set of particles following Newton's law of universal gravitation was made.
